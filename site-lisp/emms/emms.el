;;; Commentary:

;; This is the very core of EMMS.  It provides ways to play a track
;; using `emms-start', to go through the playlist using the commands
;; `emms-next' and `emms-previous', to stop the playback using
;; `emms-stop', and to see what's currently playing using `emms-show'.

;; But in itself, this core is useless, because it doesn't know how to
;; play any tracks --- you need players for this.  In fact, it doesn't
;; even know how to find any tracks to consider playing --- for this,
;; you need sources.

;; A sample configuration is offered in emms-setup.el, so you might
;; just want to use that file.
